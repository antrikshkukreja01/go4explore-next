                Our community and guidelines allows you to seamlessly replace
                any of an individual in your bookings. Please pay attention that
                this feature is applicable only when the status of your booking
                is “Paid” and there should be at least 7 days remaining prior to
                the departure date. Please note that the replacement would not
                be applicable on any Volvo/Train/Flight transport booked for
                that particular participant. The same would be automatically
                cancelled and the same will be followed by. This is simply done
                because the seats booked in such transport mediums are not
                transferable or refundable.

              Go4Explore reserves the right to cancel your booking or change any
              of the facilities, services or prices described in our brochures
              or website. We will endeavor to advise you of any changes known at
              the time of booking. We plan the arrangements for your trips many
              months in advance and may occasionally have to make minor
              changes.. Transport timings and carriers shown or communicated on
              our website are for guidance only and are subject to change. We
              will send you the final itinerary closer to the departure dates
              (2-3 days prior) along with the tickets (wherever applicable).
              However in the field of adventure activities, there are many
              variables beyond our control like weather conditions, landslides,
              road situations and any other force majeure conditions.
              Circumstances amounting to "force majeure" include any event which
              we or the supplier of the service(s) in question could not even
              with all due care, foresee or forestall such as (by way of example
              and not by way of limitation) war, threat of war, riots, civil
              disturbances, industrial disputes, actual or threatened terrorist
              activity and its consequences, natural or nuclear disasters, fire,
              epidemics, health risks and pandemics, acts of God, unavoidable

              airports or ports, hurricanes and other actual or potential
              adverse weather conditions, and any other similar events. In such
              situations we might be forced to change the itinerary or even
